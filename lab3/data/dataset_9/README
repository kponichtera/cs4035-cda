These files were generated as part of a research project in the CVUT University, Prague, Czech Republic.
The goal is to store long-lived real botnet traffic and to generate labeled netflows files.

Pcap files:
- capture20110817.pcap
It is a capture with all the traffic (background, normal and botnet)
This pcap file is not made public because it contains too much private information about the users of the network.

- botnet-capture-20110817-bot.pcap
Capture with only the botnet traffic. It is made public.

Netflow files:
- capture20110817.pcap.netflow.labeled
This file has the netflows generated by a unidirectional argus. The labels were assigned as this:
1- First put Background to all the flows.
2- Put LEGITIMATE to the flows that match some filters.
3- Put Botnet to the flows that come to or from the IP address 147.32.84.165

The filters for normal (or legitimate) traffic had the IP address of our co-workers in the lab that we are sure were not infected because we check their computers by hand.

Timeline
========
mié ago 17 12:01:01 CEST 2011
We started the overall pcap capture.
We have the bandwith to 100kbps, but only for 147.32.84.165 ip address

We are going to start the VMs one by one, without infecting them while capturing the traffic. These traffic will serve as 'normal' packets. After that we will infect each of the vms but not at the same time. We will try to mimic a real infection.


mié ago 17 12:27:44 CEST 2011
We started the normal capture. This capture is used to know exactly how the windows computers behave when they are not infected.

Pcap file:
normal-capture-20110817.pcap

	mié ago 17 12:27:48 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman

	mié ago 17 12:29:34 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman1

	mié ago 17 12:30:53 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman2

	mié ago 17 12:32:18 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman3

	mié ago 17 12:33:44 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman4

	mié ago 17 12:35:07 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman5

	mié ago 17 12:37:45 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman6

	mié ago 17 12:39:17 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman7

	mié ago 17 12:40:39 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman8

	mié ago 17 12:42:08 CEST 2011
	We started the VM saruman9

	At 13:01:03 some strange packets were sent to 3389 port using TCP (RDP protocol). The connection was made from 82.162.140.147 IP address to 147.32.84.192. 
	Our VM answer this. The remote IP (from rusia) tried to connect to the RDP using the user name 'a' (mstshash=a) and we think it was unsuccessful.
	This was a remote attack to our normal vm.
	Attack ended at 13:10:34

	We have a lot of these attacks, but they are not from our bots. Every incoming SYN packet to our vms on 3389 port is an outside attack.
